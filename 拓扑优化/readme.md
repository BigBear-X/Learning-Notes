# Examples
## A short Cantilever

> The solid material is assumed with Young’s modulus of 1 MPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3 for example. The filter radius rmin = 2mm

## A biaxial stress problem
> Solid, void, and two-phase projection results for the biaxial stress problem with prescribed minimum length scales of dmin = 0:04 and 0.02 units are shown in figure on a 200 x 200 element mesh.
