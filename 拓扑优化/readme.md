# Examples
## A short Cantilever

> The solid material is assumed with Young’s modulus of 1 MPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3 for example. The filter radius rmin = 2mm

## an arch-shaped long bridge

> an arch-shaped bridge design with a 72 m arch clear-span and a maximum ramp slope limited to 1 : 20 that results in a maximum arch depth of about 1,8 m. According to the design code, a static loading of 4 kPa pressure was applied to the deck of the bridge. a roller at the bottom of one pier and a pin at the other.
